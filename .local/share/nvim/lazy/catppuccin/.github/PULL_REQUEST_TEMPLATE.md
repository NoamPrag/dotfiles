ðŸŽ‰ First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! ðŸŽ‰

Here are some guidelines:
- Format code using [stylua](https://github.com/johnnymorganz/stylua).
- New plugin integration should be added in alphabetical order:
  - to the [README](https://github.com/catppuccin/nvim#integrations) (vimdoc is auto-generated).
  - to [types.lua](https://github.com/catppuccin/nvim/blob/main/lua/catppuccin/types.lua)
- Create a topic branch on your fork for your specific PR.
- Use [conventionalcommits.org's](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)
  rules for explicit and meaningful commit messages.
- If it's your first time contributing to a project, then read
  [About pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests)
  on Github's docs.

Here are some tips:
- Use `vim.g.catppuccin_debug = true` to get live config re-loading
